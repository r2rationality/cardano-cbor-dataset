-- | The conformance report a verification run publishes.
--
-- Node implementors publish this same shape from their own suites, so the
-- field names and their meaning are a contract with consumers of the dataset
-- rather than an internal detail. The README carries the specification; this
-- module is its one implementation, and the two must be changed together.
--
-- Fields are written in the order the specification lists them, and rules are
-- written in name order, so two reports for the same corpus diff cleanly.
